IronBefunge
================

IronBefunge is an interpreter (written in .NET) for Befunge programs. Currently it (kind of) supports Befunge-93, but the intent is to support Funge-98 for a 2-dimensional space in the near future (see http://catseye.tc/view/funge-98/doc/funge98.markdown for details on the specification).
