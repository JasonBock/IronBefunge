What should InstructionHandlers do if it gets an instruction it doesn't know what to do with? Exception? "Unimplemented"?

Need tests for InstructionMapper.

EnsureStack may be useless in some cases...

Check all ExecutionContexts for delta changes ... mostly for tests to make it easy to check ALL changes "before" and "after".

Should HashSet be used for handled instruction?

Create the IronBefunge logo. "Front" - IronBefunge with the "ef" enclosed like the element Fe (http://cutlerscove.com/kwg/knife-steel.htm) ... maybe even make it BeFunge with the "eF" in the square and everything in the square is reverse? :) "Back" is a Befunge program that prints "Directional Computation" LFCR "+" LFCR "CLR" LFCR "=" LFCR "IronBefunge"
